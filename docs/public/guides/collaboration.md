@john Great explanation of the new feature at 2:15!
One question: how does this handle edge cases with
large datasets?

The design mockup at 5:30 looks fantastic. Have we
considered how this will work on mobile devices?

Action item: @sarah can you create a follow-up
video showing the implementation details?
```
