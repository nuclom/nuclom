The Organizations API provides endpoints for managing team organizations, member roles, and organizational structure for video collaboration.

<Note>
  For complete endpoint documentation including request/response schemas, see the [OpenAPI specification](/openapi.json) or the [Interactive API Reference](/docs/api/reference).
</Note>

## Overview

Organizations are the top-level entity for team collaboration. Each organization can have multiple members, channels, and series to organize video content.

## Key Concepts

### Member Roles

Organizations support two roles:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **owner** | Full administrative access including deletion rights and member management |
| **member** | Can view and create content but cannot manage organization settings |

### Organization Ownership

Every organization has exactly one owner who has full control including:

- Managing organization settings
- Adding/removing members
- Updating member roles
- Deleting the organization

### Organization Slug

Each organization has a unique slug used in URLs (e.g., `/org/my-team/videos`).

<Note>
  Slugs must be lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens, unique across all organizations, and 3-50 characters long.
</Note>

## Data Models

### Organization

```typescript
interface Organization {
  id: string;          // UUID
  name: string;        // Display name
  slug: string;        // URL-safe identifier
  description?: string;
  logo?: string;       // Logo image URL
  createdAt: string;   // ISO 8601 timestamp
  updatedAt: string;   // ISO 8601 timestamp
}
```

### OrganizationMember

```typescript
interface OrganizationMember {
  id: string;
  organizationId: string;
  userId: string;
  role: "owner" | "member";
  user?: User;         // Included when fetching members
  createdAt: string;
}
```
