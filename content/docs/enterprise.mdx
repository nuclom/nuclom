## Overview

For organizations with specific compliance, security, or deployment requirements, we offer custom enterprise solutions beyond our standard Pro plan.

<Note>
Most organizations find our **Pro plan** ($79/user/month) meets their needs with SSO/SAML, audit logs, dedicated account manager, and 12-hour response SLA. Contact us only if you need the custom options below.

## When to Consider Enterprise

You may need a custom solution if:

- **Regulatory compliance** requires data to stay in specific regions or on-premises
- **Security policies** mandate deployment within your own cloud environment
- **Integration needs** require custom development for proprietary internal systems
- **Scale** exceeds 100 users and you need volume pricing
